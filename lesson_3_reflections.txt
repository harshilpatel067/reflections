When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
for easy collaboration and remote access.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

manual changes makes it easire to manage as per requirement. Automatic update can affect the chnages which are not finished in local.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks to clone repository on git hub.
clones to get repository from git hub to local.. or make copy on local from local.
branch is work on same repository with a copy from certain commit.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
github will be easier than git


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
branch is to test local personal changes. Master should be used as a hub for collaborating all branch changes.
