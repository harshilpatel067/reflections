my notes

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git allows logical commits.
we can track changes using logs commit. 
all chnages can be tracked using commit and not particular file change.


one commit can reflect changes in multiple files.

git log
use this get history of chanages with commit ids

git diff
use it to identify the chnage between two commits


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

we revert to any commit point using git checkout
